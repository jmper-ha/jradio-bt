    The Windows twin of tools/idf.sh, and it exists for the same reason: a
    freshly cloned project has nothing on PATH, so the VS Code tasks cannot
    call idf.py directly. The two scripts search the same way, prefer the same
    version and print the same lines - a change to one belongs in the other.
